<article class="bungalows"><h2 class="about__primary-header">Bungalows</h2><p class="about__lead">A restored colonial villa, the former guesthouse of a British tea company, offering cool plantation-style rooms close to Old Cochin’s historic spice district</p><p class="bungalows__text">An island-like peninsula between Lake Vembanad and the Arabian Sea, Fort Cochin was once the centre of Kerala’s international spice trade. Arabic and Oriental traders rubbed shoulders with Jewish merchants; Dutch, Portuguese and British colonists added to the mix; and all made their mark here. On a wide boulevard nudging the ocean, among white-washed churches and back-street synagogues, the Tea Bungalow is part of that old-world legacy.<br>Built in 1912 as the offices of a British company trading in coir and spices, it was bought by Brooke Bond in the 1950s and used as a staff guesthouse for visiting managers. By the time it was sold again, some 50 years later, it was empty and semi-derelict. A 2-year restoration followed, and in 2009 it re-emerged as a small heritage hotel. Under low red-tiled roofs there's a wide veranda, with original French doors opening onto a walled garden shaded with banana, avocado and jack-fruit trees. Inside, the décor nods towards colonial imperialism (there is a picture of the Queen on the stairwell), but the airy rooms, luxury bathrooms and the glittering tiled pool are new-born 21st century.</p><p class="bungalows__reviewed">Reviewed by John Smith</p></article><article class="top3" ahtl-top3="bungalows"><section class="top3__item" ng-repeat="item in top3.resort"><img class="top3__img" ng-src="{{top3.getImgSrc($index)}}" width="400" height="200"><h3 class="top3__header">{{item.main.name}}</h3><p class="top3__desc">{{item.desc}}</p><ul class="top3__details"><li class="top3__detail" ng-repeat="detail in item.details">{{detail}}</li></ul></section></article>
